## üìÑ About the Project

This project displays a unified flowchart that maps occupational categories across multiple classification systems:

- **ISCO 1988**
- **ISCO 2008**
- **SOC 2010**

The visualization is interactive and searchable, built using [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/) and [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) for fuzzy search.
